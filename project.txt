Amur Leopard:
The Amur leopard is one of the rarest big cats in the world, 
native to the temperate forests of the Russian Far East and 
northeast China. With a stunningly beautiful coat of golden 
fur adorned with black rosettes, the Amur leopard is highly 
elusive and known for its solitary nature. Threatened by 
habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, efforts 
to conserve this majestic predator are crucial for its survival.

Vaquita:
The vaquita, often referred to as the "panda of the sea," is 
the world's smallest and most endangered porpoise species, found 
exclusively in the northern Gulf of California, Mexico. With a 
population estimated to be fewer than 10 individuals, this shy 
and elusive cetacean is threatened primarily by bycatch in illegal 
gillnets used for fishing the endangered totoaba fish. Conservation 
efforts are urgently needed to prevent the vaquita from becoming 
extinct.

Javan Rhino:
The Javan rhinoceros is one of the rarest large mammals on Earth, 
with only a handful of individuals surviving in the dense rainforests
 and lowland grasslands of Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, Indonesia. 
 Recognizable by its single horn and prehistoric appearance, this 
 critically endangered species is threatened by habitat loss, poaching 
 for its horn, and small population size, making it extremely vulnerable 
 to extinction.

Saola:
Known as the "Asian unicorn," the saola is an enigmatic and critically 
endangered bovine species native to the dense forests of the Annamite 
Range in Vietnam and Laos. With its distinctive long horns and striking 
facial markings, the saola is incredibly elusive, with few confirmed 
sightings in the wild. Threats such as habitat destruction, hunting, 
and accidental snaring pose significant challenges to the survival of 
this elusive and mysterious species.

Sumatran Elephant:
The Sumatran elephant is a critically endangered subspecies of Asian 
elephant found on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Smaller than its 
African relatives, with more rounded ears and a prehensile trunk, the 
Sumatran elephant faces numerous threats, including habitat loss due 
to deforestation, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching for its tusks 
and ivory. Conservation efforts aimed at protecting its remaining forest 
habitat and mitigating human-elephant conflicts are essential for the 
survival of this iconic species.
